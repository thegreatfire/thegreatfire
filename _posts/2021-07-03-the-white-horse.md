Thankfully our upcoming gig at Printers Playhouse is still going ahead as a ticketed event. There are ONLY 36 TICKETS AVAILABLE so please book now by emailing info@printersplayhouse.co.uk or contacting us directly. 

We're bringing our eclectic, electric playlist to Printers Playhouse. We look forward to playing feel-good covers from more than 5 decades of Pop, Rock, Funk and Blues.
